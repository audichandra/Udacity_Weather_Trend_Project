
For this task, I used 3 big cities from my country (Indonesia): Bandung, Surabaya and Jakarta.

/* Query 1 - query used for insight for Bandung */

WITH indo AS(SELECT *
FROM city_list c
WHERE c.city = 'Bandung'),

t1 AS(SELECT cd.year AS Year, i.city AS City, i.country AS Country, cd.avg_temp AS Avg
FROM city_data cd
JOIN indo i
ON cd.city = i.city AND cd.country = i.country
WHERE cd.avg_temp IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 3,2,1)

SELECT t1.year, t1.Avg, g.avg_temp
FROM global_data g
JOIN t1
ON t1.year = g.year


/* Query 2 - query used for insight for Surabaya */

WITH indo AS(SELECT *
FROM city_list c
WHERE c.city = 'Surabaya'),

t1 AS(SELECT cd.year AS Year, i.city AS City, i.country AS Country, cd.avg_temp AS Avg
FROM city_data cd
JOIN indo i
ON cd.city = i.city AND cd.country = i.country
WHERE cd.avg_temp IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 3,2,1)

SELECT t1.year, t1.Avg, g.avg_temp
FROM global_data g
JOIN t1
ON t1.year = g.year



/* Query 3 - query used for insight for Jakarta */

WITH indo AS(SELECT *
FROM city_list c
WHERE c.city = 'Jakarta'),

t1 AS(SELECT cd.year AS Year, i.city AS City, i.country AS Country, cd.avg_temp AS Avg
FROM city_data cd
JOIN indo i
ON cd.city = i.city AND cd.country = i.country
WHERE cd.avg_temp IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 3,2,1)

SELECT t1.year, t1.Avg, g.avg_temp
FROM global_data g
JOIN t1
ON t1.year = g.year
